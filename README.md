# Hexast.In Internship Projects
This repository consists of my *Hexart.In* projects.
## This consist of three project
1. Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Python
2. Train and Give Inputs to a Machine Learning Model
3. Classification with Neural Networks using Python
# REPOSITORY Details
All python code in the Jupyter Notebooks directory
Required datasets are present in DATASETS directory
For more details check the ppts in PPT directory
# About Project
All the three projects are done as a part of "Hexart.In" Internship.
## 1. Flipkart Reviews Sentimental Analysis
Here, we are required to analyze the sentiments on the Flipkart dataset. We have reviews and ratings given by the customers and according to them, we are required to perform a Sentimental Analysis. Sentimental Analysis also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. It can be said that sentimental analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiments in text.
## 2. Train and Give Inputs  to a Machine Learning Model
In this task, we are required to train a model and give inputs to them. Here, we will be using Linear Regression which is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm. 
## 3 Classification with Neural Networks using Python
*Cassification*is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm and is described as the process of recognizing, comprehending, and categorizing things and thoughts into predefined groups, also known as "subpopulations." *Artificial neural networks (ANN)* more commonly referred to as neural networks (NN), are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute human brains. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) consist of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
